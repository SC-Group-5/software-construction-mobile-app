## Understanding Software Construction and Collaboration  
**Group Assignment – End of Week 2 (Theory-Based)**

### 1. Difference between programming and software construction (with one real-world example)
**Programming** focuses on translating logic into a programming language through the act of writing code to solve a specific problem or to implement an algorithm to solve a hypothesis.
**Software Construction** is a much broader engineering concept that integrates programming plus other activities needed to build a working software system such as designing mocules, writing tests, debugging the code, integrating different components, managing the code quality and ensure that the code is maintainable.
*Real-world example: Building an E-commerce Shopping Cart*
**Programming perspective** A programmer writes a function to calculate the total price of items in a buyer's cart.
**Software Construction perspective** A software engineer building the above same feature will have to consider;
-Error handling: What should happen if an item has an unvailable quantity of an invalid price.
-Testing: Writing standard tests to verify that the calculation works with cases like an empty cart, discounts.
-Integration: How this particular code connects to the database, payment gateway
-Performance: How will it perform when the cart has 100+ items?
-Maintainability: Using clear naming, adding documentation, following team coding standards
Etensibility: Ensuring that the code can be maintained for example adding dynamic pricing later.

**Software construction** is the complete engineering process that includes programming plus designing maintainable systems, thorough testing, debugging, documentation, integration, team collaboration, and ensuring long-term reliability and adaptability.

**Example**  
Writing a quick script to organize files by type is **programming**.  
Building a global ride-sharing app like Uber (with real-time tracking, secure payments, scalability for millions of users, safety features, team development, and constant updates) is **software construction**.

### 2. Situation where poor maintainability could cause serious problems



### 3. Why version control is critical in team-based software development.





### 4. How code reviews improve both software quality and developer skills.
Code reviews improve software quality by allowing team members to examine each other’s code before it is merged into the main project. On platforms like GitHub, this is usually done through pull requests, where changes are reviewed before approval. During the review process, team members can spot bugs, logical errors, security issues, or inefficient code early, reducing the chance of serious problems later. Code reviews also help ensure that agreed coding standards and project requirements are followed consistently across the team.

Code reviews also support developer learning and skill improvement. Through comments and feedback on pull requests, developers learn better ways to structure code, write clearer logic, and follow best practices. Reviewing others’ pull requests helps team members understand different approaches to solving problems and improves their ability to read and evaluate code. The approval process on GitHub encourages collaboration and accountability, ensuring that code is not merged without review. Over time, this leads to improved teamwork, stronger coding skills, and higher-quality software.
