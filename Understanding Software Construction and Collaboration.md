## Understanding Software Construction and Collaboration  
**Group Assignment – End of Week 2 (Theory-Based)**

### 1. Difference between programming and software construction (with one real-world example)


### 2. Situation where poor maintainability could cause serious problems



### 3. Why version control is critical in team-based software development.
1. It keeps a complete, permanent history of every modification, so the team always knows who changed what, when, and why and there will be no issues of data loss yet it can be recovered.
2. It enables developers to create separate branches for new features, bug fixes, or ideas, and later merge only the successful work.
3. It makes collaboration much easier by providing clear mechanisms to detect and resolve conflicts when two people edit the same piece of code.
4. It allows the team to roll back to a previous working version quickly if a new change introduces serious problems.
5. It provides traceability and accountability, which is especially important for debugging, auditing, compliance, and understanding decisions made months or years earlier.
6. It builds trust among team members because everyone can see exactly what was changed and by whom, reducing blame and misunderstandings.
7. It enables modern development practices such as continuous integration, code reviews, automated testing, and release management.




### 4. How code reviews improve both software quality and developer skills.
Code reviews improve software quality by allowing team members to examine each other’s code before it is merged into the main project. On platforms like GitHub, this is usually done through pull requests, where changes are reviewed before approval. During the review process, team members can spot bugs, logical errors, security issues, or inefficient code early, reducing the chance of serious problems later. Code reviews also help ensure that agreed coding standards and project requirements are followed consistently across the team.

Code reviews also support developer learning and skill improvement. Through comments and feedback on pull requests, developers learn better ways to structure code, write clearer logic, and follow best practices. Reviewing others’ pull requests helps team members understand different approaches to solving problems and improves their ability to read and evaluate code. The approval process on GitHub encourages collaboration and accountability, ensuring that code is not merged without review. Over time, this leads to improved teamwork, stronger coding skills, and higher-quality software.
