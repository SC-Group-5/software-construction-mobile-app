**Selected App:** Spotify  

This README contains our group's complete submission for Assignment 1. We analyzed Spotify, a music streaming app we all use frequently for discovering and listening to music, podcasts, and more.

## 1. App Overview

**What problem does this app solve?**  
1. Relation to Copyright, spotify provides legal, licensed access to music, reducing illegal copying. Artists and record labels are paid for streams, which protects copyright ownership. By making music easy and affordable to access, Spotify helps prevent copyright infringement.
2. Access & Convenience Problem as before streaming services, people had to buy individual albums/songs or rely on radio. Music was spread across platforms like HowweBiz for local Ugandan music, Tubidy for international pop and hip-hop, and Boomplay for African genres. Spotify provides instant access to millions of songs of all genres in one place on-demand from any device without needing to purchase, download, or store music files locally. You can listen anywhere, anytime.
3. Artist Distribution & Monetisation: For artists, getting music to listeners traditionally required record labels and physical distribution. Spotify provides a direct distribution channel where independent artists can reach global audiences and earn royalties based on streams.

Basically, Spotify democratised music access while solving the friction between discovery, cost, and convenience.

**Who are its primary users?**
1. Music enthusiasts, casual listeners, podcast listeners, and fitness users that are young adults (18-34 years). This is Spotify's largest demographic segment. Millenials and Gen Z are the most active users, comfortable with streaming technology and digital music consumption.
2. Content creators, Artists and Podcasters. Musicians, bands, podcaster, and audiobook creators who upload and distribute content through Spotify. They use Spotify for Artists/Podcasters dashboards to track analytics and earnings.


## 2. Core Features

List 5–7 key features of Spotify (based on current app experience):

1. **User authentication and Profile System/The login or signup page:** There are multiple options like Email, Google, Facebook and Apple. There is also profile managemet, and account settings where users can manage their subscription tier (Free, Premium, Family, Student plans).
2. **The search functionality:** A powerful search bar that lets you find songs, artists, albums, playlists, podcasts, and audiobooks. It includes filters and a search history to quickly access previous queries.
3. **Offline Downloads:** Permits saving content for offline use, emphasizing data storage strategies for reliability.
4. **Lyrics Display(Real-Time Synced):** Shows timed lyrics during playback, a feature that ties UI with timing algorithms.
5. **Personalized Recommendations:** Made for You sections like Daily Mixes, Discover Weekly, and Release Radar based on listening history.
6. **Streaming Playback & Controls:** Full player interface with play/pause, skip, shuffle, repeat, volume, queue management, lyrics toggle, casting (Spotify Connect), and share options.
7. **Personalized Home Feed:** Dynamic homepage that displays recommended playlists like Daily Mixes, Discover Weekly, and Release Radar based on listening history, new releases, and curated sections and the time of day as well.
8. **Playlist Creation & Management:** Provides the ability to create, edit, and organise custom playlists, add songs to library, collaborate on playlists with friends, reorder tracks with drag-and-drop, and download for offline listening Premium).
9. **Payment & Subscription Management:** In -app payment gateway for upgrading to Premium, managing billing information, changing subscription plans, and accessing payment history. Multiple payment methods supported (Credit card, mobile carrier billing)
10. **Library & Collection Organisation:** "Your Library" section where you can organise saved songs, albums, artists, podcasts, and audiobooks into folders and custom categories for easy access and management 


## Part B: Thinking Behind the Scenes

**Feature 1: User authentication/The login and registration.**
 - Likely software components involved:
  - User Interface (UI): Login screen with options (Continue with email, phone, Google); step-by-step flows for credentials or account selection.
  - Business Logic: Validates input, handles selected login method, creates secure session.
  - Network / APIs: Communicates with Spotify auth servers and external providers (e.g., Google OAuth).
  - Data Storage: Stores auth tokens locally; user data on Spotify servers.

Requires Internet Connectivity?: Yes (for verification).
If Network Slow or Unavailable: Login fails, pages may not load, user cannot access account (cached session may allow limited continued use if previously logged in).

**Feature 2: The search functionality.**   
- Likely software components involved:  
  - User Interface (UI):
       Search icon (magnifying glass), Search screen with a text input field, Categories and suggestions (songs, artists, albums, playlists), Results list that updates as the user types.
  - Business logic:
      - Interprets what the user types
      -  Decides how to rank results (songs first, artists, playlists)
      -  Filters and matches search terms with Spotify’s catalog
  - Network / APIs:
      - Sends the search query to Spotify servers
      - Receives matching results (songs, artists, albums, playlists)
  - Data storage: 
     - Temporary caching of recent searches
     - Search history saved to improve recommendations
 Does it require Internet?: Yes.
 If Network Slow/Unavailable: Results load slowly or fail; falls back to cached searches or shows "No internet" message; local library search may work partially.

**Feature 3: Offline Downloads.**
- Likely software components involved:  
  - User Interface (UI):
     - Download toggle buttons on individual songs, albums, and playlists
     - Progress indicators (per track / batch / overall download progress)
     - Dedicated “Downloads” / Offline Library section in Your Library to browse and access downloaded content
  - Business logic:
     - Checks Premium subscription / download permission before starting
     - Manages download queue (ordering, pausing, resuming, canceling)
     - Prioritizes downloads based on user preferences (e.g., Wi-Fi only, data saver mode)
     - Handles storage management (available space checks, automatic cleanup of oldest/lowest-priority items if needed)
     - Manages DRM encryption/decryption and license validation
     - Checks download expiration / license renewal requirements
     - Handles offline playback requests (locates local files, verifies DRM, plays content)
  - Network / APIs:
     - Performs initial API calls to authorize the user (Premium subscription check) and obtain download permissions / licenses
     - Fetches encrypted audio content directly from Spotify’s content delivery network (CDN) when the device is online
     - Downloads music files (in encrypted chunks / segments) from Spotify servers / CDN during active internet connection
     - Syncs download status, playlist changes, and metadata updates with the cloud
     - Periodically communicates with servers to refresh DRM licenses, check expiration (e.g., requiring online reconnection every ~30 days), and validate content
  - Data storage:
    -  Encrypted audio files stored securely in the app’s local secure storage area (device file system / app sandbox)
     - All downloaded music files are kept encrypted on the device to enforce DRM protection
     - Saves associated metadata locally, including: song info (title, artist, album), album artwork, playlist structures, download progress, and expiration / license data
     - Uses a local database or structured files to manage offline content organization and quick access
- Requires Internet Connectivity?: Yes to download; No to play saved content.
- If Network Slow or Unavailable: New downloads pause/fail; already-downloaded content plays normally.

**Feature 4: Lyrics Display(Real-Time Synced).** 
- Likely software components involved:  
  - User Interface (UI): 
    - Scrollable lyrics panel/view (typically below the Now Playing screen or integrated over Canvas/album art on mobile)
    - Real-time line-by-line highlighting and auto-scrolling synced to playback position (karaoke-style)
    - Current lyric line prominently highlighted (e.g., bold/color change)
    - Fallback messaging: “Lyrics not available,” “Lyrics unavailable,” or static/plain text display when timed lyrics fail to load
    - Support for language selection (where multiple translations exist) 
  - Business logic: 
    - Continuously matches current song playback position (including seek, pause, resume, skip) to the corresponding lyric timestamp
    - Handles real-time syncing: updates highlighted line, auto-scrolls to keep current line in view
    - Manages edge cases: crossfade effects, speed adjustments, or playback interruptions that could desync lyrics
    - Supports user interactions: tap to jump to a line (seek playback), manual scroll override with auto-resume
    - Determines fallback: switches to plain (non-timed) lyrics or error state if timed data is missing/unavailable
  - Network / APIs: 
    - Fetches timed/synced lyrics data from Spotify’s lyrics service or licensed third-party providers (primarily Musixmatch) via API calls
    - Retrieves lyrics on song start/change, or when user opens the lyrics view
    - Supports real-time updates for newly added/edited lyrics (e.g., artist-submitted via Musixmatch)
    - May include metadata like available languages or translation options
  - Data storage: 
    - Temporary/local cache of recently viewed lyrics (including timed timestamp data) stored on device for faster reload and partial offline support
    - Caches song-lyrics mapping and timing info to enable quicker access on repeat plays
    - Cache is temporary/not persistent like offline music downloads (may clear on app restart, cache limits, or after time)

- Does it require Internet? Yes for initial fetch; cached lyrics may work offline.
- If Network Slow/Unavailable: Lyrics fail to load or appear delayed/out-of-sync; app shows “Lyrics unavailable” or static text.

**Feature 5: Personalized Recommendations.**
 - Likely software components involved:
   - User Interface:
     - Carousels and lists like "Discover Weekly."
   - Business Logic:
     - Machine learning models to analyze listening patterns and suggest content.
   - Network/APIs:
     - APIs to send user data and receive recommendation responses from servers.
   - Data Storage:
     - Local storage for user preferences; cloud for aggregated data.
       
- Does it require Internet? Yes, for updating recommendations.
- If Network Slow/Unavailable: Stale recommendations from last sync; new listens aren't factored in until reconnected, potentially reducing personalization accuracy.

**Feature 6: Creation and management of playlists.**
- Likely software components involved:  
    - User Interface (UI):
      - Screens to create, name, edit, and delete playlists;
      - drag-and-drop or add/remove tracks;
      - share and collaborative playlist options.
    - Business Logic:
      - Handles playlist creation, editing, and deletion.
      - Manages permissions for collaborative playlists
      - Enforces limits (number of songs, playlist size).
    - Network / APIs:
      - Syncs playlist changes to Spotify servers
      - Fetches updates from shared/collaborative playlists
      - Communicates with friends’ accounts for collaboration.
    - Data Storage:
      - Stores playlist structure locally for offline access
      - Syncs metadata (song order, collaborators, playlist info) with cloud storage.
    - Does it require Internet? Yes for creating, sharing, and collaborating on playlists.
         Partly for accessing already downloaded songs in a playlist offline.
      
- Requires Internet Connectivity?: Partial (local edits possible); full sync/collaboration needs internet.
- If Network Slow or Unavailable: Local changes save but don't sync; collaborative updates delayed; potential conflicts on reconnect. 

**Feature 7: Streaming Playback & Controls.**
- Likely software components involved:  
  - User Interface (UI): Now Playing screen with large album art, progress bar, play/pause, skip, shuffle, repeat, queue button, and lyrics toggle.
  - Business logic: Manages audio buffering, adaptive bitrate switching (based on network speed), handles playback interruptions (calls, notifications), queue logic.
  - Network / APIs: Streams audio chunks from Spotify’s CDN using adaptive streaming protocols (HLS/DASH), fetches metadata updates.
  - Data storage: Temporary in-memory buffer and small local cache for preloading.

- Does it require Internet? Yes for streaming (unless content is downloaded).
- If Network Slow/Unavailable: Buffering occurs frequently, audio quality drops automatically, playback pauses or stops. Downloaded songs continue playing.



## Part C: Change and Maintainability

**Chosen change scenario:**
(Other options: Add offline support, Support 10× more users, Introduce dark mode across the app, Add mobile payments in Uganda)

**Which parts of the app would need changes?**  
1.**New Feature Proposal: AI Voice-Enabled Control (Accessibility-Focused)**
  - This feature introduces voice command support powered by AI, allowing users especially those with disabilities (e.g., visual impairments, motor disabilities, or anyone who can't easily type or tap) 
  - to navigate, search, play music, view/control lyrics, and manage the app hands-free.
  - It builds on existing device voice assistants (like Google Assistant, Siri, or built-in speech recognition) while adding app-specific deep integration for a seamless, Spotify-like experience.
    
2.More training is needed for the model that works on recommendations, because most of the time, this model brings results that are totally different or still brings more recommendations of songs from one artist. This is a common problem with Afro music and Amapiano, in that it doesn't even differentiate between slow and fast Amapiano.

3.**Search & Lyrics Handling.**
  - Cache more search results and lyrics locally for longer basing on the user experience,these can be used to provide results to the  user incase they decide to search while offline  or accessing lyrics offline.

4. **Smart Auto-Downloads:**
   -Effortlessly keeps your favorite music ready offline by automatically downloading your most played songs, liked tracks, and frequently enjoyed podcasts—so your go-to vibes are always available, even without a connection.
   

**What existing features could break?**  
1.Lyrics sync might fail on slower processors due to timing demands 
  - Real-time highlighting and auto-scrolling could lag or stutter if the device can't keep up with playback position calculations. 
2.Personalized recommendations could become less accurate or load much slower 
  - heavy ML models or large payloads might crash or timeout on low-end devices.
3.Playback might stutter if buffering isn't optimized for low RAM.
4. UI responsiveness (e.g., scrolling home feed, switching tabs) might degrade
  - heavy animations or simultaneous image loading could freeze the app.
5. Offline mode reliability
  - If storage management becomes too aggressive, users might lose recently downloaded content unexpectedly.


**Why would this change be difficult to implement?**  
1. Because the system is already deployed
     Millions of users rely on the current app, so changes must not break existing features or disrupt user experience.
2. Voice control requires deep integration across many features
     Adding AI voice commands affects search, playback, lyrics, playlists, and navigation, meaning many parts of the app must be redesigned to respond to voice instead of touch.
3. High computational cost on low-end devices
     Speech recognition, AI processing, and real-time responses require CPU, memory, and battery power, which low-end smartphones may not handle well.
4. Complex testing and accessibility requirements
     The feature must work across different accents, languages, noise levels, and devices, making testing and quality assurance much harder.
5. Tight coupling with existing systems
     Recommendation models, search, and playback systems are already tightly connected, so changing or extending them risks unexpected bugs and performance issues.

## Part D: Software Construction Challenges

Identify **at least 5** engineering challenges in maintaining/improving Spotify. Explain each briefly.

1. **Performance and scalability**  
    - Ensuring the app stays fast and responsive even when many users are streaming at the same time, when millions of users play music simultaneously, servers can become overloaded.
    - Engineers must prevent   buffering, slow loading, and crashes while still delivering personalized recommendations.

2. **Security and data privacy**  
    - Protecting user accounts and personal data while keeping login simple, spotify keeps users logged in using authentication tokens. If these tokens are not well protected, accounts can be compromised.
    - User  listening history and personal data must also be secured during storage and transmission.

3. **Testing across devices and OS versions**  
    - Making sure the app works properly on all devices, spotify runs on many Android and iOS devices with different screen sizes, hardware limits, and operating system versions.
    - Testing all these combinations is difficult and time-consuming.

4. **Reliability under poor network conditions**  
    - Keeping the app usable when internet connections are slow or unstable, in areas with weak networks, the app must handle buffering, reconnection, and offline playback smoothly.
    - Poor handling can lead to crashes, failed downloads, or loss of user data.

5. **Backward compatibility**  
     Adding new features without breaking older app versions, many users still use older devices and operating systems.
   Engineers must ensure new updates do not cause failures on these devices, which limits how fast the app can evolve.

## Part E: Group Reflection

As a group, we reflected together on what this analysis taught us about real-world software like Spotify.

1. **What surprised your group most about the complexity behind this app?**  
    - **Collaborative playlists** really shocked us the idea that multiple people can create, edit, add songs, and even play together in real time (like in Jam sessions) seems simple as users, but behind it there is complex engineering. It involves real-time synchronization across devices, handling conflicts when two friends add the same song or remove tracks at the same time, managing permissions, and making sure everyone sees the same updated list without delays. We never imagined how much networking, conflict resolution, and backend logic is needed just for friends to share a playlist smoothly.  
  - The massive scale of personalization surprised us too features like Discover Weekly and Daily Mixes are built on analyzing billions of listening sessions worldwide using machine learning, yet it feels instant and personal on our phones.  
- We were also surprised by how tightly everything connects changing one small thing (like search ranking) can affect recommendations, playback, and even offline downloads, showing how interconnected large systems really are.

2. **Why is writing “working code” not enough for software systems at this scale?**  
    - Millions of users expect near-zero downtime, fast responses, and a consistent experience across countries and devices. A small bug, slow loading, or crash affects huge numbers of people, damages reputation, loses subscribers, or even reduces artist royalties so code must be reliable under real pressure, not just “work” on one phone.  
  - At Spotify's massive scale, code must be fast, secure, easy to maintain and test, and resilient to network issues, device differences (especially low-end phones common in Uganda), traffic spikes (e.g., new album drops), and constant changes from new features. Simply writing working code on a single machine doesn't guarantee it will perform reliably for millions of users worldwide or survive years of updates without becoming a mess (technical debt).  
- Large systems are built and changed by teams over many years so the code needs to be readable, modular, well-tested, and designed for evolution. “Working” today is not enough if it becomes impossible to improve safely tomorrow.

3. **What did you learn about teamwork from this exercise?**  
   - It became much easier to tackle a large number of ideas when we divided roles one person focused on features, another on challenges, etc. — because everyone brought different perspectives and we covered more ground without getting stuck.  
   - Assigning clear responsibilities helped us finish work on time every member knew their part was a must-do, so people delivered their sections promptly instead of waiting until the last minute. This made the whole document stronger and less stressful.  
   - We learned that good teamwork needs open discussion and compromise sometimes we disagreed on how complex something was (e.g., collaborative playlists), but talking it through and combining our thoughts gave us better, more complete answers than any one person could write alone. Using shared tools (like Google Docs before GitHub) also helped us see everyone's edits in real time.
