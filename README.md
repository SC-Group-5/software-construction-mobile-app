# Software Construction - Behind the App: Thinking Like Software Engineers

**Course:** Software Construction   

**Assignment Type:** Mobile application analysis 

**Group Members:** Rebecca Alinda., Anna Akumu., Namaganda Wakabi Precious., Odongkara Oscar., Joseph Mukama

**Selected App:** Spotify  

This README contains our group's complete submission for Assignment 1. We analyzed Spotify, a music streaming app we all use frequently for discovering and listening to music, podcasts, and more.

## 1. App Overview

**What problem does this app solve?**  
1. Relation to Copyright, spotify provides legal, licensed access to music, reducing illegal copying. Artists and record labels are paid for streams, which protects copyright ownership. By making music easy and affordable to access, Spotify helps prevent copyright infringement.
2. Access & Convenience Problem as before streaming services, people had to buy individual albums/songs or rely on radio. Music was spread across platforms like HowweBiz for local Ugandan music, Tubidy for international pop and hip-hop, and Boomplay for African genres. Spotify provides instant access to millions of songs of all genres in one place on-demand from any device without needing to purchase, download, or store music files locally. You can listen anywhere, anytime.
3. Artist Distribution & Monetisation: For artists, getting music to listeners traditionally required record labels and physical distribution. Spotify provides a direct distribution channel where independent artists can reach global audiences and earn royalties based on streams.

Basically, Spotify democratised music access while solving the friction between discovery, cost, and convenience.

**Who are its primary users?
1. Music enthusiasts, casual listeners, podcast listeners, and fitness users that are young adults (18-34 years). This is Spotify's largest demographic segment. Millenials and Gen Z are the most active users, comfortable with streaming technology and digital music consumption.
2. Content creators, Artists and Podcasters. Musicians, bands, podcaster, and audiobook creators who upload and distribute content through Spotify. They use Spotify for Artists/Podcasters dashboards to track analytics and earnings.


## 2. Core Features

List 5–7 key features of Spotify (based on current app experience):

1.Lyrics sync might fail on slower processors due to timing demands                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        .
2.Playback might stutter if buffering isn't optimized for low RAM.

**Why would this change be difficult to implement?**  
1. **Because the system is already deployed**
   - Spotify has hundreds of millions of users on the current codebase; any optimization must be rolled out gradually (e.g., via feature flags or A/B testing) without breaking the experience for high-end device users.
3. **Tight coupling between features**
   - Many UI elements (e.g., Now Playing, Home feed) share the same rendering pipeline and data models; optimizing one often affects others, risking regressions.
5. **Device fragmentation**
   - Android alone has thousands of device models with different screen sizes, RAM amounts (e.g., 1–2 GB common on low-end), processors, and OS versions; thorough testing across real hardware is expensive and time-consuming. 

## Part D: Software Construction Challenges

Identify **at least 5** engineering challenges in maintaining/improving Spotify. Explain each briefly.

1. **Performance and scalability**  
   [Brief explanation... e.g., Handling millions of concurrent streams and personalized recommendations requires massive backend scaling without latency.]

2. **Security and data privacy**  
   1. one time login that kepps you logged in and this maybe insecure.
   2. 

4. **Testing across devices and OS versions**  
   [Brief... e.g., Ensuring the app works consistently on thousands of Android/iOS devices, old/new versions, and varying hardware.]

5. **Reliability under poor network conditions**  
   [Brief... e.g., In areas with unstable internet (common in Uganda), buffering, offline fallbacks, and reconnection logic must be robust.]

6. **Backward compatibility**  
   [Brief... e.g., New features can't break older app versions or devices still in use by millions.]

(Add more if you want, e.g., Tight coupling between features, handling large-scale data for recommendations.)

## Part E: Group Reflection

1. **What surprised your group most about the complexity behind this app?**  
   1. collaborative playlist. this involves creation of music playlist with friends and playing
   2. 

3. **Why is writing “working code” not enough for software systems at this scale?**  
   1. 
   2. 

5. **What did you learn about teamwork from this exercise?**  
   1. Easier to tackle about a number ideas
   2. finishing work in time in that every member will deliver work in time since the aspect given to them is a must do for them.
   3. 

## Group Contributions (Required)
- **Member 5 Name**: [e.g., Handled reflections in Part E and ensured clear formatting]
