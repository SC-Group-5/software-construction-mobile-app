# Software Construction - Behind the App: Thinking Like Software Engineers

**Course:** Software Construction   

**Assignment Type:** Mobile application analysis 

**Group Members:** Rebecca Alinda., Anna Akumu., Namaganda Wakabi Precious., Odongkara Oscar., Joseph Mukama

**Selected App:** Spotify  

This README contains our group's complete submission for Assignment 1. We analyzed Spotify, a music streaming app we all use frequently for discovering and listening to music, podcasts, and more.

## 1. App Overview

**What problem does this app solve?**  
1. Relation to Copyright, spotify provides legal, licensed access to music, reducing illegal copying. Artists and record labels are paid for streams, which protects copyright ownership. By making music easy and affordable to access, Spotify helps prevent copyright infringement.
2. Access & Convenience Problem as before streaming services, people had to buy individual albums/songs or rely on radio. Music was spread across platforms like HowweBiz for local Ugandan music, Tubidy for international pop and hip-hop, and Boomplay for African genres. Spotify provides instant access to millions of songs of all genres in one place on-demand from any device without needing to purchase, download, or store music files locally. You can listen anywhere, anytime.
3. Artist Distribution & Monetisation: For artists, getting music to listeners traditionally required record labels and physical distribution. Spotify provides a direct distribution channel where independent artists can reach global audiences and earn royalties based on streams.

Basically, Spotify democratised music access while solving the friction between discovery, cost, and convenience.

**Who are its primary users?
1. Music enthusiasts, casual listeners, podcast listeners, and fitness users that are young adults (18-34 years). This is Spotify's largest demographic segment. Millenials and Gen Z are the most active users, comfortable with streaming technology and digital music consumption.
2. Content creators, Artists and Podcasters. Musicians, bands, podcaster, and audiobook creators who upload and distribute content through Spotify. They use Spotify for Artists/Podcasters dashboards to track analytics and earnings.


## 2. Core Features

List 5–7 key features of Spotify (based on current app experience):

1. User authentication and Profile System/The login or signup page: There are multiple options like Email, Google, Facebook and Apple. There is also profile managemet, and account settings where users can manage their subscription tier (Free, Premium, Family, Student plans).
2. The search functionality: A powerful search bar that lets you find songs, artists, albums, playlists, podcasts, and audiobooks. It includes filters and a search history to quickly access previous queries.
3. Offline Downloads: Permits saving content for offline use, emphasizing data storage strategies for reliability.
4. Music Player Controls: Full-featured playback interface with play/pause, skip, shuffle, repeat, volume control, queue management, lyrics display, and casting to other devices (Spotify Connect) as well the share button.
5. Personalized Home Feed: Dynamic homepage that displays recommended playlists like Daily Mixes, Discover Weekly, and Release Radar based on listening history, new releases, and curated sections and the time of day as well.
6. Playlist Creation & Management: Provides the ability to create, edit, and organise custom playlists, add songs to library, collaborate on playlists with friends, reorder tracks with drag-and-drop, and download for offline listening Premium).
7. Payment & Subscription Management: In -app payment gateway for upgrading to Premium, managing billing information, changing subscription plans, and accessing payment history. Multiple payment methods supported (Credit card, mobile carrier billing)
8. Library & Collection Organisation: "Your Library" section where you can organise saved songs, albums, artists, podcasts, and audiobooks into folders and custom categories for easy access and management 


## Part B: Thinking Behind the Scenes

For each of the features listed above, discuss:

- Likely software components involved:  
  - User Interface (UI)  
  - Business logic  
  - Network / APIs  
  - Data storage  

- Whether the feature requires internet connectivity
- 1. It rquires for live streaming
- What might happen if the network is slow or unavailable
- 1. You will only be able to access the downloaded content
  2. some features like the colloborative creation of playlists and messaging services wo't be available

**Feature 1: User authentication/The login and registration.**
 - Likely software components involved:
 - User Interface (UI)
     Login screen with options:
        Continue with email
        Continue with phone number
        Continue with Google
     If email is selected → user is taken to an email and password screen
     If phone number is selected → user is taken to a screen to enter phone number
     If Google is selected → user is shown a list of Google accounts to choose from
     This shows how the app guides the user step-by-step.
  - Business Logic
      Determines which login option the user selected
      Validates email/password or phone number
      Handles Google authentication flow
      Creates a secure user session after successful login
  - Network / APIs
      Communicates with Spotify authentication servers
      Uses Google authentication APIs for “Continue with Google”
      Sends and verifies login credentials
  - Data Storage
      Stores authentication tokens locally on the device
      Stores user account data securely on Spotify servers
  - It requires internet, if there is no internet then the authentication process will not go through.
  - If the network is slow or unavailable:
      Login pages may not load
      Verification may fail
      User cannot access their account

Feature 2: The search functionality   
- Likely software components involved:  
  - User Interface (UI):
    1. Search Bar/Input field with a test input box with a placeholder tex, a clear/X button to reset input.
    2. Search suggestions dropdown with a list suggested search terms as you type, recent searches section.
    3. Search button/icon with a clickable search icon to trigger search and active/inactive states.
    4. Category Filter Tabs with tab buttons "All", "Songs", "Artists", "Albums", "Playlists", "Podcasts", "Profiles"
    5. Search Results Container with a grid or list ayout for results and a scrollable area.
    6. Results Cards/List items with thumbnail/album art image, title text, subtitle/artist name text, duration/ metadata text, play button overlay, three-dot menu (for options), and hover effects.
    7. Empty State Display with "No results found" message
    8. Search history panel with a list of recent searches, "clear all" button, and individual delete buttons per search term.

## Part C: Change and Maintainability

**Chosen change scenario:** [Pick ONE, e.g., Optimize the app for low-end smartphone            ]  
(Other options: Add offline support, Support 10× more users, Introduce dark mode across the app, Add mobile payments in Uganda)

**Which parts of the app would need changes?**  
1.

**What existing features could break?**  
1.Lyrics sync might fail on slower processors due to timing demands.
2.Playback might stutter if buffering isn't optimized for low RAM.

**Why would this change be difficult to implement?**  
1. Because the system is already deployed.
2. 

## Part D: Software Construction Challenges

Identify **at least 5** engineering challenges in maintaining/improving Spotify. Explain each briefly.

1. **Performance and scalability**  
   [Brief explanation... e.g., Handling millions of concurrent streams and personalized recommendations requires massive backend scaling without latency.]

2. **Security and data privacy**  
   1. one time login that kepps you logged in and this maybe insecure.
   2. 

4. **Testing across devices and OS versions**  
   [Brief... e.g., Ensuring the app works consistently on thousands of Android/iOS devices, old/new versions, and varying hardware.]

5. **Reliability under poor network conditions**  
   [Brief... e.g., In areas with unstable internet (common in Uganda), buffering, offline fallbacks, and reconnection logic must be robust.]

6. **Backward compatibility**  
   [Brief... e.g., New features can't break older app versions or devices still in use by millions.]

(Add more if you want, e.g., Tight coupling between features, handling large-scale data for recommendations.)

## Part E: Group Reflection

1. **What surprised your group most about the complexity behind this app?**  
   1. collaborative playlist. this involves creation of music playlist with friends and playing
   2. 

3. **Why is writing “working code” not enough for software systems at this scale?**  
   1. 
   2. 

5. **What did you learn about teamwork from this exercise?**  
   1. Easier to tackle about a number ideas
   2. finishing work in time in that every member will deliver work in time since the aspect given to them is a must do for them.
   3.
