# Software Construction - Behind the App: Thinking Like Software Engineers

**Course:** Software Construction   
**Assignment Type:** Mobile application analysis 
**Group Members:** [Rebecca Alinda., Anna Akumu.,Wakabi Precious Namaganda., Odongkara Oscar., Joseph Mukama]  
**Selected App:** Spotify  

This README contains our group's complete submission for Assignment 1. We analyzed Spotify, a music streaming app we all use frequently for discovering and listening to music, podcasts, and more.

## 1. App Overview

**What problem does this app solve?**  

**Who are its primary users?**  
1.

## 2. Core Features

List 5–7 key features of Spotify (based on current app experience):

1. 
2. 
3.  
4.  
5.  
6. 
7.   

[Discuss briefly why these are core if needed.]

## Part B: Thinking Behind the Scenes

For **each** of the features listed above, discuss:

- Likely software components involved:  
  - User Interface (UI)  
  - Business logic  
  - Network / APIs  
  - Data storage  

- Whether the feature requires internet connectivity  
- What might happen if the network is slow or unavailable  

**Feature 1: [e.g., Personalized playlists and recommendations]**  
- Components:  
  -  

**Feature 2: [Name it]**  
[Your group's reasoning here...]  

**Feature 3: [Name it]**  
[Your group's reasoning here...]  

(Continue for all 5-7 features)

## Part C: Change and Maintainability

**Chosen change scenario:** [Pick ONE, e.g., Optimize the app for low-end smartphone            ]  
(Other options: Add offline support, Support 10× more users, Introduce dark mode across the app, Add mobile payments in Uganda)

**Which parts of the app would need changes?**  
[Your and animations, lighter recommendation logic, etc.                  ]

**What existing features could break?**  
[Your answer here... e.g., High-quality audio might become unavailable, personalized features could slow down or fail on low RAM, syncing across devices might struggle.]

**Why would this change be difficult to implement?**  
[Your answer here... e.g., Testing on thousands of low-end device models/OS versions, balancing performance without degrading experience for high-end users, handling varying network conditions in regions like Uganda.]

## Part D: Software Construction Challenges

Identify **at least 5** engineering challenges in maintaining/improving Spotify. Explain each briefly.

1. **Performance and scalability**  
   [Brief explanation... e.g., Handling millions of concurrent streams and personalized recommendations requires massive backend scaling without latency.]

2. **Security and data privacy**  
   [Brief... e.g., Protecting user listening data, preventing unauthorized access, complying with global privacy laws like GDPR.]

3. **Testing across devices and OS versions**  
   [Brief... e.g., Ensuring the app works consistently on thousands of Android/iOS devices, old/new versions, and varying hardware.]

4. **Reliability under poor network conditions**  
   [Brief... e.g., In areas with unstable internet (common in Uganda), buffering, offline fallbacks, and reconnection logic must be robust.]

5. **Backward compatibility**  
   [Brief... e.g., New features can't break older app versions or devices still in use by millions.]

(Add more if you want, e.g., Tight coupling between features, handling large-scale data for recommendations.)

## Part E: Group Reflection

1. **What surprised your group most about the complexity behind this app?**  
   [Your group's answer... e.g., How much machine learning, microservices, and global scaling is involved just to suggest the next song.]

2. **Why is writing “working code” not enough for software systems at this scale?**  
   [Your answer... e.g., It must be maintainable by teams, scalable to millions, secure, testable across devices, and evolvable over years without breaking existing users.]

3. **What did you learn about teamwork from this exercise?**  
   [Your answer... e.g., Dividing roles helped cover different perspectives, but real discussion and merging ideas was key to deeper insights.]

## Group Contributions (Required)
- **Member 5 Name**: [e.g., Handled reflections in Part E and ensured clear formatting]

All members contributed meaningfully through brainstorming sessions and reviews.
